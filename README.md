# Getting started with eBPF in Go

Repo with my personal experimentation with eBPF and Go.

Mostly based on [this talk](youtube.com/watch?v=uBqRv8bDroc) by Liz Rice and [her Git repo with examples](https://github.com/lizrice/libbpfgo-beginners).

## V1

This branch is the initial iteration of a simple eBPF program.
